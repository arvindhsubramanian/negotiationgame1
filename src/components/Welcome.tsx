    <p>
      Welcome to the wacky world of WAC negotiations!

      Picture this: you're sitting in your professor's office, sweating bullets, as their academic associate is finalizing everyone's grades with a clicky-clacky keyboard.
      So, are you ready to put your negotiation skills to the test and become the ultimate WAC negotiator? It's time to show your professor who's boss and negotiate your way to academic greatness!
